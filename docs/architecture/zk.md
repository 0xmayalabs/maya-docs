# ZK

## Overview

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) are a form of cryptographic protocol that enables one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a certain statement is true, without revealing any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
This technology is crucial in contexts where privacy and security are paramount, as it allows for the verification of data authenticity without exposing the underlying data itself.

## Applications in Maya Protocol

Within the Maya Protocol, ZK proofs play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of digital media. For instance, in the Maya ZK Editor, users can generate a ZK proof to certify that an image is authentic and has not been tampered with since its certification.
This proof, along with a hash of the image, is then stored on the blockchain. When verification is required, the stored ZK proof can be used to verify the image's authenticity without the need to access the original image file, thereby ensuring the privacy of the original data and preventing any possibility of forgery or misinformation.

## Benefits

- **Verifiable Integrity**: ZK provides verifiable integrity, also known as glass-to-glass integrity, ensuring that the authenticity of digital content is maintained from the moment of capture to its display on a visual display.
- **Internet Scale Media Verification**: With significant advancements in ZK technology, it now provides the necessary infrastructure that can support verifiability of all kinds of media. It will secure all digital media interactions
by generating cryptographic proofs that verify the integrity and authenticity of content without revealing any additional information.
