# Integrity

It's important to note that cryptographic attestations don't necessarily ensure integrity of media content.
For example, the following visual illustrates the **provenance** of a photo captured by an attested camera:

**Attestation** only ensures verifiable provenance using digital signatures. Whereas, **Authenticity** ensures verifiable provenance using Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
