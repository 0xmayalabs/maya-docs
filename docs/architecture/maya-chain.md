# Maya Chain

Blockchain technology underpins the **Maya Chain**, offering a transparent and immutable audit trail for digital media.

The core benefits include:
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: The Maya Chain functions as a transparent and immutable audit trail, recording all provenance and authenticity information about digital media. This ensures that the history of any piece of content can be traced and verified publicly, enhancing trust and accountability.
- **Provenance**: By maintaining detailed records of provenance and authenticity proofs, the blockchain ensures that any alterations or edits to digital media are accurately documented and verifiable. This capability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of content in a decentralized environment.
- **Decentralizing Trust**: Blockchain technology is essential for decentralizing trust and reputation, moving away from reliance on centralized institutions to provide authenticity. By distributing trust across a decentralized network, the Maya Protocol enhances the security and reliability of digital media verification, making it resilient to tampering and fraud.

The **Maya Chain** serves as a coordination layer, providing a single source of truth for the authenticity of all digital media content on the internet. It enforces a common standard for media authenticity, such as which proof system to deploy for verifying digital content, ensuring consistency across various platforms.

Additionally, the **Maya Chain** provides composability with multiple apps and services that want to use Maya for media authenticity, such as reputation systems and decentralized AI, enabling seamless integration. The use of a custom blockchain solution allows for easy upgrades, such as adding new cryptographic proof systems, and can be optimized for scalability to meet the evolving needs of digital media verification.
