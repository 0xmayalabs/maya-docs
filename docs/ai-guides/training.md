# Training

Maya unlocks transparency in AI training by providing verifiable proofs about the origins
of training data and ensuring that it is legally and ethically sourced.

Transparency is critical for AI training systems to comply with regulations such as the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
and to guarantee the quality and integrity of AI models. With Maya, data curators can now prove the provenance of training data
to AI training platforms, ensuring that the data used in the training process is not poisoned or tampered with,
and includes information on the proportion of synthetic (AI-generated) data used.

## Core Benefits

1. **Provide Verifiable Proof**: Data curators can offer verifiable proof of training data,
ensuring confidence in the origins of training data.
2. **Build Credibility**: By using Maya, data curators can build credibility and trust with AI training platforms,
ensuring only data with user consent is used and that it is not sourced from a “do not train” database.
3. **Ethical and Legal Compliance**: AI training platforms can verify that the training data is ethically and 
legally sourced, ensuring compliance with regulations such as the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/).

## Integration

You can integrate Maya’s SDK **(currently in development)** into your data collection & processing pipelines to ensure verifiability
of final data from the source through subsequent processing steps such as normalization, reduction and sanitization.

Steps for Integration:
1.	**Install the SDK**: Add the Maya SDK to your data processing pipelines to enable cryptographic verifiability of final data.
2.	**Initialize the SDK**: Configure the SDK with your project-specific settings to start tracking data modifications.
3.	**Track Data Provenance**: Use the SDK to prove and store the provenance of data at each stage of your workflow.
4.	**Verify Data Integrity**: Ensure the integrity of your data at any point in your workflow using the SDK’s verification features.
