# Training

Maya unlocks transparency in AI training by providing verifiable proofs about the origins
of training data and ensuring that it is legally and ethically sourced.

Transparency is critical for AI training systems to comply with regulations such as the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
and to guarantee the quality and integrity of AI models. With Maya, data curators can now prove the provenance of training data
to AI training platforms, ensuring that the data used in the training process is not poisoned or tampered with,
and includes information on the proportion of synthetic (AI-generated) data used.

## Core Benefits

1. **Provide Verifiable Proof**: Data curators can offer verifiable proof of training data,
ensuring confidence in the origins of training data.
2. **Build Credibility**: By using Maya, data curators can build credibility and trust with AI training platforms,
ensuring only data with user consent is used and that it is not sourced from a “do not train” database.
3. **Ethical and Legal Compliance**: AI training platforms can verify that the training data is ethically and 
legally sourced, ensuring compliance with regulations such as the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/).

## Integration

You can hook Maya's SDK (in development) in your data collection workflows to track the provenance
of data from source to subsequent processing steps like normalization, reduction & partitioning.
