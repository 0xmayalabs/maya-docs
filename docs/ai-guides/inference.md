# Inference

Maya enhances transparency and safety in AI inference, ensuring that AI-generated content
(AIGC) is traceable, ethically produced and regulatory compliant.

## Core Benefits

1. **Traceability of AI-Generated Content**: Maya provides secure and private traceability for AI-generated content, allowing
users to verify the origins and authenticity of AI outputs.
2. **Protection of Creator Rights**: Maya protects the rights of creators using generative AI for various art forms, including
photography, music, and animated videos. It ensures that creators receive proper attribution and protects their intellectual property rights.
3. **Detection of Malicious Deepfakes**: Maya flags the use of AI models to create malicious deepfakes, thereby maintaining
the integrity and trustworthiness of AI-generated content.

## Integration

Maya provides SDKs **(currently in development)** that directly integrate with AI inference platforms to attest to AI-generated content at the source.

For inference platforms, such as generative AI platforms, follow these steps:

1.	**Install the SDK**: Incorporate the Maya SDK into your inference platform to enable real-time attestation of AI-generated content.
2.	**Initialize the SDK**: Set up the SDK with your specific configuration to start attesting inference outputs.
3. **Attest Content Integrity**: Utilize the SDK to generate and attach verifiable proofs to AI-generated content, ensuring it is traceable and ethically produced.
