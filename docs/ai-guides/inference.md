# Inference

Maya enhances transparency and safety in AI inference, ensuring that AI-generated content
(AIGC) is traceable, ethically produced and regulatory compliant.

## Core Benefits

1. **Traceability of AI-Generated Content**: Maya provides secure and private traceability for AI-generated content, allowing
users to verify the origins and authenticity of AI outputs.
2. **Protection of Creator Rights**: Maya protects the rights of creators using generative AI for various art forms, including
photography, music, and animated videos. It ensures that creators receive proper attribution and protects their intellectual property rights.
3. **Detection of Malicious Deepfakes**: Maya flags the use of AI models to create malicious deepfakes, thereby maintaining
the integrity and trustworthiness of AI-generated content.
