## About us
[Maya Labs](https://mayalabs.tech) is building the first **authenticity layer**, leveraging zero-knowledge technology to offer seamless 
and secure authenticity verification of digital media content. Our approach eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, ensuring content
credibility for creators of high-value media content and combating AI-deepfakes.

## Maya Protocol
The authenticity layer is secured by the **Maya Protocol**, a decentralized protocol for media authenticity.
The protocol leverages **zero-knowledge technology** to enable onchain verification of media authenticity, thus enhancing privacy and content integrity in the AI-driven digital landscape.

Our protocol serves as the **foundational layer** that is **open and credibly neutral**, allowing anyone to certify the authenticity of their images, audios, or videos.
Audiences can **trustlessly verify** authenticity on-chain, ensuring that the media they engage with, whether a voice or a video, truly originates from the claimed source.

On top of this protocol, individuals and businesses can develop products and services that offer media verification services. This capability fosters **coordination and flexibility** across the ecosystem.
By employing [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof), the Maya Protocol ensures that the authenticity of digital media is verified without compromising the underlying data, thereby ensuring both **privacy and security**.

The ZK proving infrastructure ensures that all content verified through our system is genuine and tamper-proof.
Additionally, the blockchain provides **immutable audit trails** that are **publicly verifiable**, allowing anyone to examine the entire content and provenance history, which cannot be altered by anyone.
