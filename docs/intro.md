## About us
[Maya Labs](https://mayalabs.tech) is building the first **authenticity layer**, leveraging zero-knowledge technology to offer seamless 
and secure authenticity verification of digital media content. Our approach eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, ensuring content
credibility for creators of high-value media content and combating AI-deepfakes.

## Maya Protocol
The authenticity layer is secured by the **Maya Protocol**, a decentralized protocol for media authenticity.
The protocol leverages both cryptographic verification techniques and decentralized social consensus mechanisms to enable secure 
verification of media authenticity.

Our protocol serves as the **foundational layer** for cryptographic truth that is **open and credibly neutral**, allowing anyone to certify the authenticity of their images, audios, or videos.
Anyone can verify authenticity trustlessly, ensuring that the media they engage with, whether a voice or a video, is authentic & truly originates from the claimed source.

On top of this protocol, individuals and businesses can develop products and services that offer media verification services. 
This capability fosters **coordination and flexibility** across the ecosystem.

The ZK proving infrastructure ensures that all content verified through our system is genuine and its integrity is intact.
Additionally, the blockchain provides **immutable audit trails** that are **publicly verifiable**, allowing anyone to
examine the entire content and provenance history, which cannot be altered by anyone.
